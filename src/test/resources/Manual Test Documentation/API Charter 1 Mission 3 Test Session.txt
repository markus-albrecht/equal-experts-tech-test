Test Session

* Sent a delete request with bookingId of 567890 (too high to have ever existed). This resulted in a 405 Method Not Allowed response. This should have been a 404 Not Found. 

* Sent a delete request with bookingId of 13442 (A previously deleted booking). This resulted in a 405 Method Not Allowed response. This should have been a 404 Not Found.

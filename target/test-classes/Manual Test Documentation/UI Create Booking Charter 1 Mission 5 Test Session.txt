Test Session

I firstly navigated to http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/  

Date Picker

* I left the check in date field blank and clicked save. The entry was not created. I repeated the action with the Network tab of dev tools open and there was an Internal server error associated with the save request.

* I selected a value of 06/02/2020 from the check in date picker and clicked save. There was a lag in the entry saving. So I impatiently selected save again. This resulted in 2 identical bookings being created. 

* I selected a value of 31/01/2020 from the check in date picker and clicked save. The booking was created. I do not think this is expected behaviour.

* I selected a value of 06/01/2050 from the check in date picker and clicked save. The booking was created. This should be discussed with the PO as to whether this is desired behaviour to have a booking created so far in the future.

* I selected a value of 20/02/2020 from the check in date picker and clicked save. Which is after the check out date. The booking was created. I do not think this is expected behaviour. 

Free Text Entry 

* I entered 22022020 into the check in field and clicked save. The booking was created. However the the checkin date was listed as 1970-01-01.

* I entered 2020-12-25 into the check in field and clicked save. The booking was created as expected.

* I entered 2020-13-05 into the check in field and clicked save. The entry was not created. I repeated the action with the Network tab of dev tools open and there was an Internal server error associated with the save request.

* I was unable to enter alpha and special characters that were not  "-". As expected. 


Potential Defects:
1) No front end validation of an empty check in date field.
2) Identical bookings can be created.
3) Bookings can be created with a check in date that is in the past.
4) Bookings can be created with a check in date that is greater than the check out date.
5) Check in dates with all numeric characters, but not in date format result in a check in date of 1970-01-01
6) Invalid date results in 500 status code but no front end notification.

Not Covered:
